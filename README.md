Hey,
Recently I visited [https://nubela.co/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-alternative-data-what-is-it-really/](https://nubela.co/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-alternative-data-what-is-it-really/) and got some information about Alternative Data. 
There's a lot of talk these days about "big data" and the insights that can be gleaned from large data sets. But what about "alternative data"?
I blogged about that here [https://hulkhack.blogspot.com/2022/11/alternative-data.html](https://hulkhack.blogspot.com/2022/11/alternative-data.html)


Found that [ProxyCurl](https://nubela.co/proxycurl/solutions/alternative-data-for-investment-firms) is the best place for alternative data.
